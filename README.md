# Product Video Ads

Product Video Ads is a solution to build video Ads at scale, by reading data
from a feed (e.g. Merchant Center feed, Spreadsheet, etc) and rendering videos
with price, product name and images variations, automatically uploading
them to Youtube, and configuring Google Ads campaigns.

The solution is intended to run on top of Google Cloud's infrastructure, so
that you don't have to worry abount setting up too many different pieces in
order to get it up and running.
